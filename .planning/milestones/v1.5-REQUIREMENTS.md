# Requirements Archive: v1.5 Bug Fixes & Stability

**Archived:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** SHIPPED

This is the archived requirements specification for v1.5.
For current requirements, see `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (created for next milestone).

---

## Encryption Fix

- [x] **ENC-01**: GitHub secrets encryption uses libsodium crypto_box_seal (replacing broken tweetnacl implementation that caused 422 errors) — VALIDATED
- [x] **ENC-02**: libsodium-wrappers loads correctly at runtime in ESM context (via createRequire CJS fallback) — VALIDATED
- [x] **ENC-03**: tweetnacl and tweetnacl-util dependencies removed from package.json — VALIDATED

## Template Fixes

- [x] **TPL-01**: Generated web projects include @testing-library/dom as explicit devDependency (peer dep of @testing-library/react v16) — VALIDATED
- [x] **TPL-02**: Generated mobile projects use @testing-library/react-native/extend-expect instead of deprecated @testing-library/jest-native — VALIDATED
- [x] **TPL-03**: Generated mobile projects use jest-jasmine2 test runner for Jest 30 + Expo SDK 53 compatibility — VALIDATED

## CLI Architecture

- [x] **CLI-01**: IAM deployment user and policy creation moved from initialize-github to setup-aws-envs (all AWS resources created together during org setup) — VALIDATED
- [x] **CLI-02**: initialize-github reads existing user name from config and only creates access key + GitHub secrets — VALIDATED
- [x] **CLI-03**: Backward compatibility preserved — initialize-github falls back to full user creation for older projects without deploymentUsers in config — VALIDATED

## Documentation

- [x] **DOC-01**: PROJECT.md key decisions updated to reflect libsodium-wrappers, createRequire, jest-jasmine2, and react-native extend-expect decisions — VALIDATED

## Out of Scope

- Performance optimizations (cached npm install, parallel validation) — future enhancement
- Watch mode for template development — future enhancement
- Multi-region deployment support — future version
