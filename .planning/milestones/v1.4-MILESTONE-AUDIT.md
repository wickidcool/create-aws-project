# v1.4 Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.4 Generated Project Validation
**Audited:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** TECH_DEBT (no blockers, minor cleanup needed)

## Executive Summary

All 13 requirements satisfied. All 5 phases complete. All integration points wired. All E2E flows functional. One minor tech debt item identified in Phase 13 (non-blocking).

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| HARN-01 | Test harness can generate projects programmatically with any platform/auth configuration | 11 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| HARN-02 | Each test run uses isolated temporary directory that doesn't pollute file system | 10 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| HARN-03 | Validation pipeline runs npm install, npm run build, and npm test sequentially | 11 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| HARN-04 | Validation captures exit codes and fails if any step returns non-zero | 11 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| HARN-05 | Temporary directories are cleaned up after successful test runs | 10 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| REPT-01 | Failed validations display captured stdout/stderr for debugging | 13 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| REPT-02 | Developer can run validation locally via npm script (npm run test:e2e) | 13 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| REPT-03 | Each validation step has timeout (10 minutes) to prevent hanging | 11 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| REPT-04 | Progress output shows which configuration is being tested | 13 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| REPT-05 | Summary table at end shows pass/fail status for all tested configurations | 13 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| CICD-01 | PR workflow runs validation on core configuration subset | 14 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| CICD-02 | Release workflow runs validation on full 14-configuration matrix | 14 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| CICD-03 | Configuration matrix supports tiered execution (core tier vs full tier) | 12 | ✓ SATISFIED |

**Coverage:** 13/13 requirements satisfied (100%)

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Name | Status | Score | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|-------|
| 10 | Test Harness Foundation | ✓ PASSED | 4/4 | No gaps, no tech debt |
| 11 | Validation Pipeline | ✓ PASSED | 6/6 | No gaps, no tech debt |
| 12 | Test Fixtures and Matrix | ✓ PASSED | 6/6 | No gaps, no tech debt |
| 13 | Reporting and Local Runner | ⚠ GAPS_FOUND | 3/4 | runValidationSuite not exported |
| 14 | CI Integration | ✓ PASSED | 4/4 | No gaps, no tech debt |

**Phases Complete:** 5/5 (100%)

## Integration Analysis

### Export/Import Wiring

| Export | Source | Consumers | Status |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| withTempDir | Phase 10 | validate-project.ts, specs | ✓ CONNECTED |
| runCommand | Phase 10 | validate-project.ts, specs | ✓ CONNECTED |
| validateGeneratedProject | Phase 11 | local-runner.ts | ✓ CONNECTED |
| TEST_MATRIX | Phase 12 | local-runner.ts, specs | ✓ CONNECTED |
| getConfigsByTier | Phase 12 | local-runner.ts, specs | ✓ CONNECTED |
| getConfigByName | Phase 12 | local-runner.ts, specs | ✓ CONNECTED |
| 14 factory functions | Phase 12 | matrix.ts | ✓ CONNECTED |
| npm run test:e2e | Phase 13 | GitHub workflows | ✓ CONNECTED |

**Connected:** 8/8 exports (100%)

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Entry Point | Exit Point | Status |
|------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Local validation | `npm run test:e2e` | Exit code 0/1 | ✓ COMPLETE |
| PR validation | PR opened | ci-complete job | ✓ COMPLETE |
| Release validation | Release published | release-complete job | ✓ COMPLETE |

**Flows Complete:** 3/3 (100%)

### Config Alignment

- **PR workflow:** 5 configs (smoke + core tier) - EXACT MATCH with TEST_MATRIX
- **Release workflow:** 14 configs (full tier) - EXACT MATCH with TEST_MATRIX

## Tech Debt

### Phase 13: Reporting and Local Runner

**Item:** `runValidationSuite` function not exported from `local-runner.ts`

**Details:**
- Plan specified `exports: ["runValidationSuite"]` but function defined without `export` keyword
- Function works correctly as CLI entry point (invoked via process.argv)
- npm scripts function correctly
- All REPT-* requirements satisfied

**Impact:**
- Severity: Low
- Blocking: No
- Functional impact: None (CLI works, all features work)

**Resolution:**
```typescript
// Change line 9 from:
async function runValidationSuite(tier: TestTier = 'core'): Promise<void>
// To:
export async function runValidationSuite(tier: TestTier = 'core'): Promise<void>
```

## Milestone Goal Achievement

**Goal:** Ensure all generated project configurations build and pass tests through automated validation.

**Achievement:** ✓ VERIFIED

Evidence:
- Test harness generates projects programmatically (14 configs defined)
- Validation pipeline runs npm install → build → test with timeout
- Tiered execution: 5 core configs on PRs, 14 full configs on releases
- Local runner with progress and summary output
- CI workflows with matrix strategy for parallel execution

## Conclusion

**Status:** TECH_DEBT

All milestone goals achieved. All requirements satisfied. All phases complete. All integration points wired. All E2E flows functional.

One minor tech debt item (missing export) does not impact functionality and can be addressed in future cleanup or deferred.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with milestone completion. Tech debt is tracked and non-blocking.
